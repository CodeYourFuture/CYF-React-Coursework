# Deploying your React Hotel app

Once you have set up your React Hotel application, we should deploy it to Netlify.

Follow the deployment instructions here:

https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app#deployment-with-netlify

Once it is deployed, follow these instructions to change your new site's name to `cyf-USERNAME-react-hotel`.netlify.app (where `USERNAME` is YOUR Github username):

https://github.com/CodeYourFuture/syllabus/blob/master/others/deployment/1-for-html-module/instructions-for-automatic-deployment-with-netlify-and-github.md#changing-your-site-name

Check that your site is visible at: https://cyf-[[your-github-username]]-react-hotel.netlify.app/.
