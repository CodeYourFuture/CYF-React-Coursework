# Setup For React App

During the React module, we will be writing code in a React app. This may take some time to do (depending on your the speed of your computer and internet) so we want you to do this BEFORE the class starts.

Follow the instructions for creating a React app here: https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/students/guides/creating-a-react-app.

Please read them carefully before you begin.

If you get stuck, please post a question in the your class channel on Slack.
